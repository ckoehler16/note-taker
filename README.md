## Description

As a developer I wanted to create a note taking application where a user can create and store their notes. The user will have the opportunity on the right side of the page to input a note title, as well as, a note text that will describe in more detail what the note entails. Once the user has completed filling in the note title and text they will have the opportunity to save the note which will then appear on the left side of the page along with any other saved notes.

## Usage

To access the Note Taker application please use the following link to get started:

[Note Taker Link](https://note-taker71622.herokuapp.com/)

Once you click on the link you are directed to the Note Taker landing page and from there please click the "Get Started" button. You are then directed to a page where you can view existing notes and create new notes. To create a new note click on the input field "Note Title" and input a title for your note. Next either 'tab' into the "Note Text" or click on it to enter a description for your note. Once both fields have been entered a 'save' icon will appear on the right side of the navigation bar, click on the icon to save the note. The new note will then appear on the left side of the page in a column where all saved notes are stored. To view a specific note, click on the note in the left hand column and it will appear on the right side displaying the title and the description of the note. To add more new notes click the '+' icon in the navigation bar at the top right of the page.
